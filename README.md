## Description

GoogleAssistant2Windows, short GA2W, is an application which executes spoken commands with the help of *Google Assistant* on your computer to control your programs, your operation system in general (currently only Windows is supported) and the computer behavior. The communication is not directly between the Google Assistant and the computer. The programm uses a detour with *IFTTT.com* and *Telegram*.

## Notice

This project is still in a early development phase. Information on how to setup/install and use the program will come soon!

### History

Once, I pre-programmed the application in AutoIt, a programming language from which I learned to program.
But I want to improve my programming skills, knowledge and my GA2W application,
so I decided to re-program the app in Python, make it better and more reliable.

### Intention

This is my first big project. I am a beginner to programming, my study just started.
I wanted to make my code public in order to share my idea. Feedback and help are welcome.

If you notice a bug or you need a feature, please open an issue and I will answer asap.
Contribution by pull requests are very welcome as well!

English is not my native language, so I am sorry about any spelling or grammar mistakes.

## Features

TODO: to be defined.

## Getting started

I was producing short "Devlog" (videos) about the progress every week on my YouTube channel.
Have a quick look if you are interested.

- [Devlog video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9IDggoskDpIRBojm6RpWjcMtCI8cIMZp) - German
- [How to set up the program](https://youtu.be/fkwVXExyV48) - German, with english subtitles

TODO: more to be defined.

## Configuration

Run `setup.py` to skip some steps from the video (Part #1 only, API-token required).
See information about the videos above.

Expected libraries:
- requests `pip install requests`
- win32api `pip install pywin32`
