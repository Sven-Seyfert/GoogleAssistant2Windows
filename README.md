## googleassistant2windows

This repository is the cloud storage for my project 'GoogleAssistant2Windows', short: GA2W. It is an application which executes commands from your Google Assistant on your computer (currently there is only Windows-support). It's not directly from the Assistant to the computer. It uses a detor with IFTTT.com and Telegram.

This project is in progress. I onced pre-programmed it in AutoIt, a programming language from which I learned to program. But I want to improve my programming skills, knowledge and my GA2W-application, so i decided to re-program the app in Python, make it better and more reliable.

I'm making short devlogs about the progress every week on my [YouTube-channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCabHmk4jCXkaMCSG3IQuMPA). It's in German though.

I'll make this repository public when the project is finished.
