## googleassistant2windows

THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. INFORMATION ON HOW TO INSTALL AND USE THE PROGRAM WILL COME SOON!

Please note: This is my first big project. I`m a beginner to programming, my study just started. I wanted to make my code public in order to share my idea. Feedback and help are welcome. If you notice a bug or you need a feature, please open an issue, and I will answer asap.

Information on the repository:
This repository is the cloud storage for my project 'GoogleAssistant2Windows', short: GA2W. It is an application which executes commands from your Google Assistant on your computer (currently there is only Windows-support). It's not directly from the Assistant to the computer. It uses a detor with IFTTT.com and Telegram.

This project is in progress. Once, I pre-programmed it in AutoIt, a programming language from which I learned to program. But I want to improve my programming skills, knowledge and my GA2W-application, so i decided to re-program the app in Python, make it better and more reliable.

I'm making short devlogs about the progress every week on my [YouTube-channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCabHmk4jCXkaMCSG3IQuMPA). It's in German though.

English is not my first language. So, yeah. Sorry about any spelling or grammar mistakes :D
